## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid, subGrid
- Javascript Events, localStorage

### What I learned

- When doing DOM updates, using innerHTML reconstructs DOM which removed event listener and resetup of all events is needed, solved it with building DIV section.

- Toggle Class don't work at once, need looping.

- Can use Grid even at smallest place, flexbox is good to play around in smallest area.

- Grid overrides the HTML parent and child hierarchy.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/) - To build grid layout
